outcome of using said reward tokens may be of a desire to enternal entities.

> Such therein, the rewards can be honoured via raffles, whitelist opportunities,
or dao utility.

Contrasting to that of the above, a participating entity may see a competitive
edge to providing their own value to these reward tokens over the owning
entity providing initial value.

> Each quest can be customized for your own project, community, or collaboration.

Such goal is to enable communities to self service their own questing campaigns.


> Quests can give purpose to communities without tokenomics via providing the
questing utility token and through modular staking design.

> Quests bring value to every project who collaborates on a quest by proxy of
combined interest in providing tokens with utility from one project.
